Python Flow Control
-----------------------

In this lesson we will cover how to write code that will execute only if 
specified conditions are met and also how to automate repetitive tasks 
using loops.

Open the file `python_flow_control.ipynb` with Canopy. Or if you are
running the virtual machine, enter the command
`ipython notebook python_flow_control.ipynb` into your terminal.
